/**
 * Viewer mode (SCOTTY_READ_ONLY=1): refuse every project-data mutation at one
 * choke point instead of guarding each route handler. Anything non-GET under
 * /api/p/ writes bead data, attachments, ordering, or publishes — all of it is
 * off-limits when the beads store is owned by an external writer (the bd CLI).
 * App-level endpoints (/api/config, /api/projects, /api/update) stay available:
 * they manage this app, not the beads data.
 *
 * The launch flag supplies the default; a session cookie can override it for
 * one browser. This is a local viewing preference, not access control.
 * UI editors honor the same effective mode.
 *
 * `proxy`, not `middleware`: Next 16 deprecated the `middleware` file
 * convention in favour of `proxy` and warns on every build. The rename also
 * pins the runtime — `proxy` is always Node and cannot be configured to Edge,
 * which is what lets this read `process.env` at request time. That matters
 * here: the global install ships a pre-built `.next`, so the flag is only ever
 * set at launch, and an Edge-runtime guard with SCOTTY_READ_ONLY inlined at
 * build time would have failed open while the UI still claimed read-only.
