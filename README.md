A local, single-user web UI for **[beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)**
(`bd`) — Steve Yegge's distributed graph issue tracker. beads ships a powerful CLI
but no interactive visualizer that also lets you *create* work. This app is that
visualizer: a fast, graph-aware task board for humans, on top of a tracker built
for AI agents.

## Features

- **Board** — a five-column view (Backlog · Ready · In Progress · Blocked · Done)
  with dense cards showing id, type, priority, assignee, dep/comment counts, and an
  origin badge. Filter by type / priority / origin, full-text search, and a
  show/hide-archived toggle. Keyboard: `n` new, `/` search, `Esc` close.
- **Backlog ↔ Ready drag-and-drop** — drag cards between columns to change status
  (Backlog = `deferred`, Done = `bd close`); updates are optimistic.
- **Create / edit** — add tasks and epics (type, priority, description, assignee,
  labels, parent epic, start-in-backlog) and edit status/priority inline.
- **Epics & progress** — epics with live `closed ÷ children` progress bars and
  expandable child lists; add a child straight into an epic.
- **Dependencies & graph** — view/add/remove typed dependencies in the detail
  drawer. The default **Readable view** keeps cards at reading size, groups tasks
  inside collapsible epics, and offers immediate task-dependency focus. Switch to
  **Full graph** for the complete React Flow edge map (drag node→node to link).
- **Comments** — author-stamped comment threads with a composer on every bead.
- **Bead links** — open a bead directly with `/p/<project>?bead=<id>`. The address
  bar follows the open drawer; its **Copy link** button copies a shareable link,
  including in read-only mode. Drawer navigation keeps its own Back trail.
- **Archive & delete** — archive (reversible `bd close` + `archived` label) or
  delete (`bd delete`, behind a confirm).
- **Human-vs-agent attribution** — every bead and comment shows 👤 (human) or 🤖
  (agent), derived from a configurable human allowlist.
- **Settings** — repo path, human actor + allowlist, poll interval, and light/dark
  theme. Live polling keeps the board fresh when agents change data underneath you.

### Focus: compare assignees and recent completions

Open **Focus** in the project sidebar. It starts with the existing ungrouped
**In flight**, **Blocked**, and **Next up** columns. In flight includes work
marked `in_progress` or `hooked`; Next up remains ready P0/P1 work.

Choose **Group by → Assignee** in the Focus header to compare each assignee's
work across those columns. Work without an assignee has its own **No assignee**
row. Choose **None** to return to the original layout.

Turn on **Recently finished** to add the latest seven matching completions,
ordered by completion time. The count shows how many are displayed out of the
full matching set; **Show all … completed** expands it, and **Show latest 7**
restores the summary. Existing label-lane filters apply before this limit.
Active and blocked work is never capped, and archived beads stay excluded.

These are temporary display controls for the current Focus visit. They don't
change bead data or the project landing-view preference. Keyboard navigation,
detail links, and read-only protections also work in the grouped layout.

## How it works

- **beads has no HTTP API**, so the app shells out to the `bd` CLI
  (`bd … --json`, `BD_JSON_ENVELOPE=1`). `bd` stays the single source of truth —
  the app adds **zero** new persisted schema. The only adapter is
  [`lib/bd.ts`](lib/bd.ts); see the spec in [`design/design.md`](design/design.md).
- The UI was designed in **Claude Design** and rebuilt faithfully here with
  Next.js + shadcn/Tailwind. The original export and a screen/token map live in
  [`design/ui-export/`](design/ui-export/).

### Backlog & attribution (design decisions)
- **Backlog** maps to beads' built-in `deferred` status; **Ready** = open &
  unblocked. Dragging between columns runs `bd update --status` / `bd close`.
- beads has no human-vs-agent flag, so the UI stamps its own writes with a
  configured **human actor** (`BEADS_ACTOR`); anyone in the human allowlist renders
  as 👤, everyone else as 🤖. **Archive** = `bd close` + an `archived` label
  (reversible); **Delete** = `bd delete`.

## Releases and updates

[Latest stable release](https://github.com/brendan-appstart/bead-me-up-scotty/releases/latest)
contains version-specific installation instructions, changes, and screenshots.
The sidebar displays the running app version.

In **Settings → Software updates**, choose **Stable releases** (the default) or
**Development (main)**. Stable checks published GitHub releases for all installation
types. Development checks the latest main commit and requires a Git checkout.
Checks run on load and every five minutes; disabling them takes effect immediately.
These GitHub requests are independent of the optional usage-statistics setting.

When a new version is available, click the sidebar notice to read its release notes.
A clean main/detached Git checkout can install the exact advertised target with
**Update now**. Dependencies are restored with `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and the app is rebuilt.
The supervised `bun run serve` launcher restarts automatically; other launchers
need a manual restart. Local changes or diverged history must be resolved first.
Global copies, source downloads, and Docker installations receive the notice with
manual update instructions. No update is installed automatically.

See [v0.2.0 release notes](docs/releases/v0.2.0.md) for the first versioned release.

## Run it

**Prerequisites:** Bun 1.4.2+. For live mode you also need the
[`bd`](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) binary on your `PATH` and a `.beads`
repo (`bd init`). No `bd`? The app falls back to demo mode automatically.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

- **With real data:** run from (or point Settings at) a directory containing a
  `.beads` repo, with `bd` on your `PATH`. Override the repo with
  `BEADS_REPO=/path/to/project` and the binary with `BD_BIN=/path/to/bd`.
- **Demo mode:** if `bd` isn't installed (or you set `BEADS_DEMO=1`), the app runs
  against an in-memory dataset seeded from the design export — so you can explore
  every feature without beads. The sidebar shows which mode is active.

Set the human actor / allowlist, repo path, and theme in **Settings** (stored
under your OS config dir, not in beads).

### Focus view

**Focus** is an optional view for current work: In flight, Blocked, and Next up
(open, unblocked P0/P1 work). Board is the default whenever you open or reload a
project. Enable **Use Focus as the default view** in Settings to start in Focus instead. This toggle is off
by default and saves automatically for all projects in the current browser.
Lower-priority backlog and completed work remain
available in Board and List.

Set `SCOTTY_LANE_PREFIX=ctx:` to enable lane filters from labels such as
`ctx:frontend`. Without a prefix, lane filters are hidden. If a selected lane
vanishes during a live refresh, Focus shows all lanes again.

### Read-only viewing

Enable **Read-only mode** in Settings to monitor progress without editing beads.
The slim **Read Only Mode** banner stays above the project workspace. Click it
to keep or disable the mode, choose a small or large banner, or pick its background
and text colors. Appearance changes are saved automatically in this browser.

The mode applies to the current browser session, including its other tabs. A
session cookie preserves it through reloads; browser session restoration may
also restore that cookie. Other browser sessions are unaffected. Settings lets
you enable it again after dismissing the banner.

Set `SCOTTY_READ_ONLY=1` (or `true`) when launching Scotty to make read-only the
default for new browser sessions. A browser can explicitly override that default
from the banner. This is a local viewing preference, not a permissions system.
Project write requests are rejected by the server while the requesting browser
is read-only; application settings remain available.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t bead-me-up-scotty .
docker run -p 3000:3000 bead-me-up-scotty      # → http://localhost:3000
```

> The build runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, which needs the committed `bun.lock` for
> reproducible installs. The lockfile is tracked in the repo (a `.gitignore`
> negation keeps it that way even if your global gitignore excludes lockfiles),
> so a clean clone builds without a prior `bun install`.

The image includes the `bd` CLI, so real data works out of the box — just
mount your project directory and point `BEADS_REPO` at it:

```bash
BEADS_REPO=/path/to/project
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  --name beads_ui \
  -v $BEADS_REPO:/data \
  -e BEADS_REPO=/data \
  bead-me-up-scotty
```

The container runs as a non-root `nextjs` user with `HOME=/home/nextjs` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/nextjs/.config`, so `bd` and app settings have a valid
runtime config directory. On Linux, if `bd` fails with permission errors writing
to the mounted `.beads` directory, run as your host user: `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`
(the config dirs are world-writable, so settings keep working). Settings live
inside the container, so they are lost when it is recreated — bind-mount the
config dir to keep them:

```bash
-v "$HOME/.config/bead-me-up-scotty:/home/nextjs/.config/bead-me-up-scotty"
```

Container limitations:

- The image has no `git`, so Dolt remote sync (`refs/dolt/data`) and `bd init`
  don't work inside it — run those on the host. UI edits (create/update/close)
  work fine; they just won't auto-push until you sync from the host.
- **Refine with AI** shells out to the Claude Code CLI, which isn't bundled;
  the button shows an error in the container.
- The bundled `bd` version is pinned in the Dockerfile (`ARG BD_VERSION`);
  override with `--build-arg BD_VERSION=<version>` to match your host.

## Install globally

Install once from a clone, then run `scotty` (or `bead-me-up-scotty`) from **any**
directory. It starts the production server on a free port (default 3000) and opens
your browser. Run it from a folder that has a `.beads` repo to jump straight to
that project; otherwise you get the project picker. Requires Bun 1.4.2+.

Flags: `-p, --port <n>` · `--no-open` · `--help`.

**Recommended — `bun link` (keep the clone):**

```bash
git clone <repo-url> bead-me-up-scotty
cd bead-me-up-scotty
bun install
bun run build
bun link
scotty                 # from anywhere
```

The global command is a symlink to the clone, so keep it on disk and re-run
`bun run build` after pulling changes. Uninstall: `bun unlink`.

## Stack

### Responsive layout

On phones, project links open the List view unless a view is explicitly linked
or Focus is your chosen default. Navigation opens from the menu beside the
project switcher; filters and graph options open in a bottom sheet. Bead details
and creation use full-screen surfaces.

Lists and boards scroll with touch. Drag-to-reorder is desktop-only; use bead
details to change status on a phone. **Readable view** uses vertical scrolling on
mobile and opens one sibling epic at a time. **Focus dependencies** shows immediate
prerequisites, the selected task, and dependents; completed prerequisites remain
visible as context, missing targets are labeled, and non-blocking relationships
stay separate. **Back to epic view** restores the expanded branch and scroll position.

Click an epic title to open its details; the rest of its header expands/collapses
the container. Readable-view arrows connect prerequisites to dependents, routing
around cards and titles. Epic-level links attach to the epic header boundary;
child-task links attach only to the actual visible child, never to its ancestor.
Expand collapsed epics to reveal those links. Completion filters also apply to
the arrows. Membership and non-blocking relationships do not become dependency
arrows; other relationship types remain available in task focus and Full graph.

**Graph direction** applies to both presentations. **Auto** flows top-to-bottom
in Readable view on every screen; Full graph retains left-to-right on desktop
and top-to-bottom on phones. An explicit direction is saved locally.
Top-down arrows leave bottom ports and enter top ports. Readable view
places dependency levels in successive rows, stacking parallel tasks on phones
instead of widening the page. Cross-epic child dependencies influence container
placement without being redrawn as epic-level links. Cycles share a level rather
than inventing an execution order. Task focus and epic expansion remain available.

Readable chains retain their lanes and merges align near their prerequisites.
Horizontal dependency columns never wrap: scroll the graph horizontally when
needed. Rounded routes prefer fewer bends, use separated attachment points and
reserve channels where space permits, without crossing cards. Hover or keyboard
focus previews upstream/downstream paths; **Highlight path** pins a selection
for touch or mouse use. **Clear path** or Escape clears it. Hidden selections
are released when their cards disappear. These interactions do not change beads.

The presentation preference is saved locally. **Full graph** remains available
for panning, pinch zoom, the epic selector, **Fit epic**, spotlight, and dependency
creation. Card heights are measured after rendering so wrapped titles remain
inside their epic containers. Readable cards are ordered by dependency layer
where possible; adjacency does not invent a dependency between unrelated tasks.

## Verify

Bun is the runtime and package manager; `bun.lock` is the only lockfile.
Biome replaces ESLint and checks the supported migrated rules. Some React
Compiler and Next-specific ESLint checks have no Biome equivalent; TypeScript
and browser regression tests remain separate checks. Historical release notes
describe their original Node/npm releases, not the current development setup.


```bash
bun run build         # typecheck + production build
bun run check         # Biome lint, formatting and import checks
bun run typecheck     # TypeScript
bun run format        # apply formatting
bun test              # Bun Test: isolated logic, telemetry and updater tests
bun run test:unit      # alias for bun test
bun --bun playwright install --with-deps chromium  # once per machine
bun run test:e2e      # Playwright Test (build first)
bun run test:e2e:ui   # interactive runner
```

Unit tests live in `tests/unit/` and use `bun:test` assertions. `bunfig.toml`
limits Bun discovery to that directory; browser scenarios in `tests/*.spec.ts`
use Playwright Test and its assertions. Tooling and both suites are strict
TypeScript and are included in `bun run typecheck`.

Playwright Test starts its own Bun-powered demo server on loopback port 43188
with a temporary settings directory and telemetry disabled. It refuses to reuse
an existing server, so browser tests cannot accidentally target your live board.
The suite runs serially because some legacy scenarios exercise shared demo
settings. Each test has fresh browser contexts, with screenshots and traces
retained on failure in `test-results/` and an HTML report in `playwright-report/`.
Run a subset with `bun run test:e2e tests/mobile.spec.ts` or rerun failures with
`bun run test:e2e --last-failed`. CI runs these same checks.

### Basic usage statistics

Scotty ships with a public, ingestion-only PostHog project token and reports one
`app_active` event per UTC day while the UI is used. **Fresh installations are
enabled and configured by default; no `.env` setup is needed.** Cloning or
installing alone does not send an event; opening the app does.

Operators can set `POSTHOG_KEY` to their own PostHog **project token**, never a
personal API key, and `POSTHOG_HOST` to their ingestion endpoint (default:
`https://us.i.posthog.com`). An explicitly empty `POSTHOG_KEY=` disables reporting
even when the preference is on. These are runtime environment settings; Next.js
also loads them from a local `.env`. Do not commit `.env` or private API keys.

**Settings → Usage statistics → Share basic usage statistics** is enabled by
default. Switching it off stops future events across all projects and browsers
connected to that local server. It does not delete previously received events.
The preference lives in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bead-me-up-scotty/telemetry.json` (default:
`~/.config/bead-me-up-scotty/telemetry.json`), outside the Beads database.
The random installation ID is stored alongside it in `telemetry.json.id`;
daily event records, attempt reservations, and acknowledgements live in
`telemetry.json.days/`. They coordinate server processes without a lock that
could remain stuck after a crash. Existing opt-outs and daily reservations
remain honored after an update.

Scotty sends only the random installation/event IDs, app version, timestamp,
and PostHog flags that disable person profiles and GeoIP enrichment. No browser analytics SDK is
loaded; no automatic page/click capture or session recording is enabled. Bead
content, project names/paths, user names, emails, URLs, and browser headers are
never included. PostHog receives the network connection and records the app
server's IP address, even though GeoIP enrichment is disabled.
An idle server/background tab sends nothing. Failures time out after three
seconds and never affect app operations. Failed deliveries can retry during
later UI use, at least ten minutes apart and at most three attempts per UTC day.
Retries retain the same event ID and timestamp for PostHog's eventual
deduplication; no past days are backfilled. Opting out stops pending retries.
If the preference cannot be read or the daily reservation cannot be saved,
reporting stops.

In PostHog, create a Product Analytics trend for `app_active`, choose **Unique
users**, and use daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. This measures approximate
active **installations**, not people: multiple machines count separately, shared
servers count once, and offline or opted-out installations are absent. Deleting the preference file restores the default setting; deleting the ID file
resets the installation identity.

Verify the capture and privacy rules with `bun scripts/test-telemetry.ts`.
The tests use temporary local storage
and a fake network transport; they do not send production events.

For the browser checks, run `bun run test:e2e tests/telemetry-ui.spec.ts`;
the runner supplies an isolated server automatically.
The test refuses to run against an installation configured to send events.

## A small usage signal, and a thank you

When PostHog reporting is configured, Scotty sends a small signal that the app
was used, at most once a day. It helps us get a rough sense of how many
installations are active and whether people keep coming back.

The event includes a randomly generated installation ID, the app version, and
a timestamp. The ID lets us recognize the same installation on another day;
it isn't your name, email, or account. We don't send your beads, project names,
file paths, or anything you type, and we don't record your sessions or clicks.
Person profiles and location enrichment are disabled. PostHog still receives
the network connection, so we don't promise “100% anonymity.”

**You can turn it off at any time in Settings → Usage statistics → Share basic
usage statistics.** That stops future events, and your choice stays saved across
restarts. The app works just as well with reporting disabled.

Feel free to disable it. But knowing that people are using the app helps my
team and me decide where to focus our time, and encourages us to keep adding
updates and making it better. I truly appreciate everyone who shares feedback,
including through this small usage signal. Seeing that something we've built
is useful to you is inspiring. Thank you for being part of it.
